# gsh-scripts
Some quick public GSH scripts I've made.  YMMV.

`display_stem_usage.gsh` - Give it a stem and it will report out the groups under that stem that are used in another group and how many times they are used.

`nuke_unused_groups.gsh` - Give it a stem and it will delete the groups under that stem that are not in use somewhere.  BE CAREFUL.
